## Overview
This project aims to predict the operational status of waterpoints in Tanzania, focusing on whether a waterpoint is functional or is non-functional. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project addresses critical water resource management issues in the region.

## 2. Business Understanding
### 2.0.1 Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to predict the operational status of waterpoints in Tanzania. By accurately predicting whether it is functional, needs repair, or is non-functional, it can help the Tanzania Ministry of Water and other stakeholders optimize operations and ensure a reliable supply of clean water to communities.

### 2.0.2 Stakeholders
- **Tanzania Ministry of Water:** Responsible for the maintenance and management of waterpoints.
- **Local Communities:** Depend on these waterpoints for their daily water needs.
- **Maintenance Team:** Tasked with repairing and maintaining the waterpoints.

### 2.0.3 Success Criteria
- **Accuracy:** The model should have high accuracy in predicting the status of waterpoints.
- **Actionable Insight:** The predictions should lead to actionable insights that can improve maintenance schedules and resource allocation.
- **Scalability:** The solution should be scalable to handle data from other regions or countries.

### 2.0.4 Key Questions
- Which factors most influence the operational status of waterpoints?
- How can we prioritize waterpoints for maintenance based on the model’s predictions?
- What patterns or trends can be identified from the data that could inform future waterpoint installations?

### 2.0.5 Constraints
- **Data Quality:** The accuracy of the model depends on the quality and completeness of the data.
- **Resource Limitations:** Limited resources for maintenance and repairs may affect the implementation of the model’s recommendations.
- **Geographical Challenges:** Remote or hard-to-reach areas may pose challenges for data collection and maintenance.

### 2.0.6 Potential Impact
- **Improved Water Access:** Ensuring that more waterpoints are functional can significantly improve access to clean water for communities.
- **Cost Savings:** Predictive maintenance can reduce costs by preventing major breakdowns and optimizing resource allocation.
- **Enhanced Decision-Making:** Data-driven insights can help policymakers and stakeholders make informed decisions about water infrastructure investments.

## 3. Data Understanding
### Dataset
The dataset includes:
1. **Training Features (`training_set_values.csv`)**: Attributes describing the waterpoints.
2. **Training Labels (`training_set_labels.csv`)**: Operational status of waterpoints.
3. **Test Features (`test_set_values.csv`)**: Attributes for prediction.

### Data Details
- **Independent Variables:** Include various geographical, operational, and structural characteristics of waterpoints.
- **Dependent Variable:** The operational status of waterpoints, classified into:
  - Functional
  - Needs Repair
  - Non-Functional

## Workflow
### 1. Business Understanding
- **Description:** This step defines the problem and objectives. It involves understanding the need to predict waterpoint statuses and how this information can aid in water resource management.

### 2. Data Understanding
- **Description:** Data is loaded and inspected to ensure quality and understand its structure. Key insights are drawn to inform the data preparation steps.

### 3. Data Preparation
- **Description:** Preprocessing tasks are performed to prepare the data for modeling. This includes:
  - Handling missing values to ensure completeness.
  - Encoding categorical variables to make them usable by models.
  - Normalizing numerical features for consistency.

### 4. Modeling
- **Description:** Machine learning models are built to predict waterpoint statuses. Techniques include:
  - Decision Trees: Simple interpretable models.
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are conducted to optimize performance.

### 5. Evaluation
- **Description:** The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine how well it predicts the waterpoint statuses.

## Results
- **Description:** The final model achieved high accuracy in predicting the operational status of waterpoints. Insights from this analysis can guide efforts to improve waterpoint functionality and maintenance.
