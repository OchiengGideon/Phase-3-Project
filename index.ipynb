    "The primary goal of this project is to predict the operational status of waterpoint in Tanzania. By accurately predicting whether it is fuctional, needs repair or is non-fuctional, it can help the Tanzania Ministry of water and other stakeholders in optimizing operations ansd ensure a reliable supply of clean water to communities."
